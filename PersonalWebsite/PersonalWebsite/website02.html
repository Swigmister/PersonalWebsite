<p><br><br>The following photo above is the game Fortnite being played on the Samsung Galaxy s9 Plus. The Samsung Galaxy s9 Plus is a 
smartphone that was released by Samsung on March 16th, 2018. It has a lot of features, but one of its most notable features 
is its oversized 6.2 inch curved screen. Also, it comes with a 12 megapixel camera with low light duel lens. The fingerprint scanner
is also centered on the back of the phone, which is a fix from the previous Galaxy s8. It boasts 6gb of RAM and has a Snapdragon 845 for
its CPU. The cost of the phone was around $700. Parth Desai thinks this phone is interesting because of the way they marketed their phone. They ended up using a 
popular game as a marketing platform to sell their phone, which is a new method of marketing that 
really hasn't been tested till the s8 plus.
